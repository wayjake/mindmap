# Drag and Drop Intro in React

This project currently uses native HTML5 browser based drag and drop. It's already fallen short considering the onDragOver doesn't give us access to what's in the users' hands.

Some next steps may be implementing some state management that let's us know what's currently held by the user so that we can know if the dropzone can accept that kind of item.

Other than that, if you just need on drag start and on drag end, this implementation will give you a great head start.

It's designed to work with Styled Components and in a React-y way which means you can supply children to the component or just utilize the drop area or draggable hooks manually.
